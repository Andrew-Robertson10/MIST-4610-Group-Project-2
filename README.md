Our dataset was found on https://catalog.data.gov/dataset which is a list of many different data set types. Our dataset contains information on all known meteorite landings worldwide. The data were collected by The Meteoritical Society, in association with NASA.
Some of the data that the set includes is the name, the class, the mass, the year it fell, and the latitude and longitude of where it fell for each meteorite.

## Question #1: Which regions of the world have the most meteorite landings?

## Question #2: How has the number of documented meteorite landings changed over time, and how will this number likely change in the future?

## Question #3: Which classes of meteorites are the most common? Which types of meteorites are the heaviest? Are heavier or lighter meteorites more common?

## Manipulations
We manipulated the data in the forecast model to forecast starting at 2009 since as we mention later on in the analysis, recent data is incomplete. We also filtered out very early data from before the 20th century, since efforts to discover meteorites did not exist back then and the number of meteorites found for each year during these time periods is either zero or in the single digits. Manipulating the data in this fashion allowed us to clean up the visualizations and better predict the future.

## Analysis and Results
We found one issue with the data set that we analyzed. Less data has been collected or the data is less complete for the more recent years. This is causing a dip in recorded data after the mid-2010s that is not necessarily representative of the number of meteorites that actually fell during these years.
