Our dataset was found on https://catalog.data.gov/dataset which is a list of many different data set types. Our data set contains information on all of the known meteorite ladnings around the world. The data was collected by The Meteoritical Society associated with NASA.
Some of the data that the set includes the name, the class, the mass, the year it fell, and the latitude and lonngitude of where it fell.

## Question #1: Which regions of the world have the most meteorite landings?



## Manipulations
We manipulated the data in the forecast model to forecast starting at 2009 since as we mention later on in analysis, recent data is incomplete.

## Analysis and Results
We found one issue with the data set that we analyzed. Less data has been collected or the data is less complete for the more recent years. This is causing a dip in recorded data after the mid-2010s that is not necessarily representative of the number of meteorites that actually fell during these years.
